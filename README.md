This is the coursework project I completed for my Year 1 module, Web and Database Systems.\
It uses a database of information to build a website recreating the functionalities of Surrey Sports Park's real site, including account creation, buying a membership, and booking onto classes.\
The home page builds a table of available classes dynamically based on filters added via a form.\
This project involved deriving business rules from a set of requirements and analysing the existing website, then creating an SQL database and queries to be sent from the website. The goal was to demonstrate our understanding of databases, including normalisation and representing information in the most optimal way possible, as well as our knowledge of HTML, CSS and building websites.
